# **Chapter 3 - The Curse**

## **DM Notes**

The discovery of the talisman triggers the curse on the island. The players will start to notice changes in their environment, and they may even start encountering spectral apparitions or aggressive wildlife. Their goal in this chapter is to understand the nature of the curse and start looking for ways to break it. 

This chapter is all about problem-solving and dealing with unexpected challenges. Remember to keep the pressure on but also give the players room to think and plan. The more they learn about the curse, the better equipped they'll be to break it.

## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "With the talisman in your possession, you feel a palpable shift in the atmosphere. The island no longer feels deserted. It feels...haunted. 

`Emily`, holding the talisman, you feel a strange connection to it. It's as if it's whispering ancient secrets to you, showing you glimpses of the island's past. You're convinced that the talisman is the key to breaking the curse. (Roll D6 + INT)

`Liz`, you start researching the symbols in earnest, hoping to find a clue or a ritual to break the curse. The ruins and the symbols are all pieces of a larger puzzle, and you're determined to solve it. (Roll D6 + INT)

`Sam`, you're on high alert. The wildlife has become more aggressive, and you've even seen spectral figures out of the corner of your eye. Your main focus is on protecting the group and ensuring your survival. (Roll D6 + STR)

As you navigate the cursed island, you encounter several challenges. From deciphering cryptic symbols to defending against spectral attacks, your survival skills are put to the test. But with each challenge, you're getting closer to breaking the curse. You just need to hold on a little longer."


## **DM Notes**

_ðŸ¤– Here are some potential situations and fallbacks for failed rolls in Chapter 3._

If the players fail their rolls, it's important to keep the story moving forward while still maintaining the challenge and tension. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Failed Deciphering Roll:** If `Liz` fails to decipher the symbols, she could partially understand them, giving the players some information but not the whole picture. This could lead to them needing to find more symbols or a key to fully understand the language. 

2. **Failed Talisman Roll:** If `Emily` fails to understand the talisman, it could unleash a burst of energy, causing a temporary setback (like a storm or a ground shake) but also revealing a glimpse of a past event or a hint to breaking the curse.

3. **Failed Defense Roll:** If `Sam` fails to defend the group, they could be injured (lose 1 HP) and forced to retreat, leading them to discover a new area or clue they wouldn't have found otherwise.

Remember, the goal is to keep the story engaging and fun. Even failures should lead to new opportunities and drive the story forward.

## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "As you navigate the cursed island, not everything goes according to plan. `Liz`, you struggle to decipher the complex symbols, only grasping a partial understanding. But even this gives you a clue to the island's past and the nature of the curse. You know you need to find more symbols to fully understand them.

`Emily`, as you try to connect with the talisman, it suddenly unleashes a burst of energy. You're knocked back, and a sudden storm engulfs the island. But amid the chaos, you catch a glimpse of a past event, a ritual that might be key to breaking the curse.

`Sam`, while defending the group, you're caught off guard by a spectral attack. You're forced to retreat, leading the group into a previously unexplored area. Here, you discover new clues and resources that could aid in your survival and quest to break the curse.

Despite the setbacks, you're making progress. The curse is powerful, but you're determined to break it."

_ðŸ¤– Here are some more epic situations and fallbacks for Chapter 3, leading into the climactic Chapter 4._


As the players get closer to breaking the curse, the island's defenses become more intense. They might have to deal with more powerful spectral attacks, aggressive wildlife, or even a natural disaster triggered by the curse. These challenges should test the limits of their skills and teamwork.

## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "As the sun sets, the island becomes even more hostile. The spectral figures are becoming more corporeal, and the wildlife is growing increasingly aggressive. 

`Sam`, while you're on watch, a group of spectral figures attacks the camp. You need to defend the group while `Liz` and `Emily` try to find a way to repel the spirits. (Roll D6 + STR)

`Emily`, you feel the talisman pulsating in response to the spectral attack. You try to harness its energy to repel the spirits. (Roll D6 + INT)

`Liz`, you notice that the symbols around the camp are glowing in response to the talisman. You try to quickly decipher them and aid `Emily`. (Roll D6 + INT)

Despite the intense battle, you manage to repel the spirits. But the island isn't done challenging you yet. A sudden earthquake shakes the ground, forcing you to seek shelter in the ruins.

Inside the ruins, you find a hidden chamber with more symbols and a pedestal that seems to be made for the talisman. As you place the talisman on the pedestal, the chamber lights up, revealing a detailed mural depicting the curse and how to break it.

With this new knowledge and the dawn of a new day, you're ready to confront the curse head-on. The final battle awaits."
