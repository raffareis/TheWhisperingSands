### Panel on entrance of the Ruins

"In the heart of the ruins, where the moonlight doesn't touch,
Lies the key to the curse, that has taken so much.
Guarded by silence, embraced by the stone,
Look not with your eyes, but with your heart alone."

### Break the curse:

"To lift the spell, reverse the call,
Return the talisman, from where it did fall.
In the chamber of echoes, where whispers are told,
Place it back gently, let the story unfold."

Hint: The talisman must be placed on the chamber of echoes

### Open the door

#### Option 1 (Joke)

"Speak not in whispers, but with mirth and delight,
Tell a tale that makes the day as bright as the night.
A joke, a jest, a jolly good cheer,
Laugh out loud, and the path will be clear."

Hint: This riddle requires the player to tell a joke. The joke doesn't have to be specific. Any joke that makes the player laugh out loud will suffice to open the stone door.

#### Option 2 (Moon)

"Speak not in whispers, but loud and clear,
The name of the one who is always near.
Two faces I hold, in darkness and light,
Say my name, and open the night."

Hint: This riddle suggests that the player needs to speak the name of the moon.

Tell me a tale that tickles the ribs, a jest that brings joy. Speak a joke that echoes with laughter through these ancient walls, and I shall grant you passage. Fail, and remain forever in the shadows of despair. Now, adventurer, make me laugh!"
