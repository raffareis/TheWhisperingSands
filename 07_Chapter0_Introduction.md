# **Introduction**

## **DM Notes**

This is the start of the adventure. The players have just survived a shipwreck and find themselves washed up on a deserted island. Their immediate priorities are to assess their situation and ensure their survival. They will soon discover that the island is not as deserted as it first appears, with strange symbols carved into the trees and an eerie feeling of being watched. 

At this point, the players are likely to be feeling confused and disoriented. Encourage them to explore their surroundings, interact with each other, and start thinking about how they will survive. This is also a great opportunity to introduce any mechanics or rules of the game.

## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "You awaken on a sandy beach, your head pounding and your clothes soaked. As your eyes adjust to the bright sunlight, you see the remains of your boat scattered around you. You're on a deserted island, with nothing but palm trees and sand as far as the eye can see.

`Sam`, you're the first to wake up. You see `Liz` and `Emily` lying unconscious nearby. What do you do?

After ensuring everyone's okay, you start to take in your surroundings. You see strange symbols carved into the trees nearby, giving you an eerie feeling. The island might not be as deserted as you first thought.

As the reality of your situation sinks in, you realize that you need to ensure your survival. You need to find food, water, and shelter. But you also can't ignore the strange symbols and the feeling that you're not alone. What do you decide to do first?"
