Before starting the adventure, make sure each player understands their character's backstory, their strengths and weaknesses, and the basic rules of the game. Provide them with a copy of their character sheet and explain how the stats and dice rolls work.

Encourage them to think as their character would when making decisions. Remind them that their choices can have significant impacts on the story and that working together as a team will give them the best chance of survival.

Finally, set the scene. Describe the desert island, the wrecked boat, and their initial surroundings. Make the situation feel real and urgent. The better they can visualize their environment, the more immersed they will be in the story.

Now, grab your dice, and let's begin the adventure!
