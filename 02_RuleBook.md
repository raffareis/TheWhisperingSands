# **"The Whispering Sands" RPG Mechanic**

## **Character Stats:**

Each character has three main stats:

1. **Strength (STR)** - Physical power and resilience.
2. **Intelligence (INT)** - Ability to solve puzzles, decipher symbols, and understand the island's mysteries.
3. **Survival (SUR)** - Ability to gather food, build shelter, and navigate the island.

Each character starts with a total of 10 points to distribute among these stats (minimum 1 point per stat).

## **Gameplay:**

Players take turns as the "lead" character for different scenes, deciding the group's actions.

## **Actions and Dice Rolls:**

When a player wants to perform an action (like deciphering a symbol, opening a heavy door, or catching a fish), they roll the D6. If the rolled number plus their relevant stat is 7 or more, they succeed. If not, they fail. The difficulty can be adjusted by the DM for more challenging tasks.

#### **Actions:**

Actions are what the characters do in response to the situations presented by the Dungeon Master. Actions can include but are not limited to things like:

- Physical tasks (climbing a tree, fighting a beast, building a shelter)
- Mental tasks (solving puzzles, deciphering symbols)
- Survival tasks (foraging for food, navigating the terrain, starting a fire)

#### **Dice Rolls:**

The outcome of these actions is determined by a dice roll. Here is how it works:

1. **Declare the Action:** The player describes what they would like to do. For example, "I want to climb that tree to get a better view of our surroundings."

2. **Determine the Relevant Stat:** The DM determines which stat is relevant to the action. In this case, climbing a tree would likely fall under Strength.

3. **Roll the Dice:** The player rolls a six-sided dice (D6). 

4. **Add the Relevant Stat:** The number rolled on the dice is added to the relevant stat from the player's character sheet. For example, if the player rolled a 4 and their Strength stat is 3, the total would be 7.

5. **Determine Success or Failure:** If the total number (dice roll + stat) is 7 or more, the action is successful. If the total is less than 7, the action fails. The DM narrates the outcome of the action based on this result.

_* Note: The DM can adjust the difficulty level for more complex tasks by setting a higher target number. For example, deciphering an ancient language might require a total of 10 or more to succeed._

Remember, the goal of the game is to have fun and engage in a collaborative storytelling experience. The dice and stats are just tools to add an element of chance and unpredictability to the adventure.

## **Health:**

Each character starts with 10 Health Points (HP). If they fail an action that could cause harm (like falling from a height or fighting a beast), they lose 1 HP. If a character's HP reaches 0, they are incapacitated and must be helped by the others.

Dica do Gatinho (Rafa): Pra poder ficar mais interessante, e poder lidar com falhas nos dados, poderia usar uma mecanica de que o player sacrifica 1 de hp pra tocar o dado de novo em determinada situação. Isso evita que tu tenha que pensar em alternativas pra caso falhe em alguns casos. Vc pode apresentar essa mecânica caso a caso, inventando uma desculpa.

## **Death and Game End:**

If all characters reach 0 HP, it's game over. However, the game encourages teamwork and resourcefulness over combat, so death should be a rare occurrence. The game ends when the players successfully lift the island's curse and signal for rescue, or if they all die. The DM narrates the ending based on the players' actions throughout the game.
