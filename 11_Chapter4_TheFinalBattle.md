# **Chapter 4 - The Final Battle**

## **DM Notes**

The final chapter of the adventure is a climactic confrontation with the curse itself. The players will have to use everything they've learned and work together to break the curse and free the island. This chapter should be epic and challenging, testing the limits of the players' skills and teamwork.

In the final chapter, the players find themselves in a hidden chamber deep within the island's ancient ruins. The chamber is filled with ancient symbols and murals that tell the story of the island and its curse. The centerpiece of the chamber is a pedestal designed to hold the talisman. 

The chamber provides a fitting setting for the final confrontation with the curse. Its ancient stone walls have witnessed centuries of history and are now about to witness the breaking of the curse.

## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "You stand in a chamber that has lain hidden for centuries, deep within the heart of the island. The chamber is vast, its stone walls covered in the same mysterious symbols you've seen throughout the island. 

At the center of the chamber is a pedestal, carved from the same stone as the chamber. It's intricately designed, clearly made to hold the talisman. As you place the talisman on the pedestal, the chamber comes to life, the symbols glowing with a soft light.

You're standing at the heart of the island's mystery, the place where the curse was first cast. Now, it's up to you to break it and free the island from its centuries-long torment. The air is thick with anticipation, the chamber waiting in silence for the ritual to begin."

ðŸ“¢ "As dawn breaks, you stand before the mural, armed with the knowledge to break the curse. The island is eerily quiet, as if holding its breath for the final confrontation.

ðŸ“¢ "As the ritual begins, the chamber comes to life. The symbols on the walls glow brighter, the ground shakes, and the spectral figures surge forward, forming a swirling vortex of energy.

_Suddenly, spectral figures materialize from the gloom. They are ghostly apparitions, their forms shimmering and translucent, like mist given form. Their eyes glow with an eerie light, casting an unnatural glow in the dark ruins._

_These spectral figures are the tormented souls of those who failed to solve the riddle, forever trapped in the ruins. They move with an otherworldly grace, their feet barely touching the ground. Their hands end in sharp, claw-like appendages, and they emit a haunting, mournful wail that echoes through the ruins._

_The spectral figures are a chilling sight, their faces twisted in eternal torment. They are not of this world, but of a realm beyond, a realm of sorrow and despair. As they approach, the air grows colder, and a sense of dread fills the room. The players must defend themselves while solving the riddle, adding another layer of challenge to their quest._

`Sam`, the first wave of spectral figures break away from the vortex and charge towards you. You stand your ground, ready to protect `Emily` and `Liz`. (Roll D6 + STR)

With the first wave defeated, `Liz`, you notice a pattern in the spectral attacks and the glowing symbols. You quickly devise a plan to use the symbols to repel the spectral figures and buy some time. (Roll D6 + INT)

`Emily`, with the immediate threat handled, you focus on the talisman. You feel its energy pulsating in sync with the symbols around the chamber. You try to harmonize with its rhythm to progress the ritual. (Roll D6 + INT)

But the island isn't done fighting. `Sam`, a larger, more powerful spectral figure emerges from the vortex and charges at you. You brace for impact, ready to hold the line. (Roll D6 + STR)

`Liz`, you notice that this figure is directly connected to the vortex. You quickly search the mural for a way to sever this connection. (Roll D6 + INT) (**Make Them Laugh**)

`Emily`, you feel a surge in the talisman's energy as the large figure attacks. You try to redirect this energy to aid `Sam` and `Liz`. (Roll D6 + INT)

After an intense battle, you manage to sever the connection and repel the large figure. The vortex shrinks, the shaking subsides, and the spectral figures retreat.

With a final push, `Emily`, you channel all the talisman's energy into the final step of the ritual. The chamber fills with a blinding light, and when it fades, the spectral figures are gone, and the island is calm.

_ðŸ¤– This concludes the adventure, leaving the players with a sense of accomplishment and relief. They've survived the island, broken the curse, and are now on their way to being rescued._
