## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "As you step out of the ancient ruins, the island feels different. The eerie silence is gone, replaced by the peaceful sounds of nature. The symbols no longer glow with an ominous light, and the spectral figures have disappeared. The curse is broken, and the island is free.

You make your way back to the beach, the journey much easier now without the constant threats. As you reach the shore, you see a ship on the horizon. You wave frantically, and to your relief, you see a signal in response. Rescue is on its way.

As you wait for the ship, you reflect on your adventure. You've faced challenges, solved mysteries, and fought off spectral figures. You've survived a deserted island and broken an ancient curse. But most importantly, you've done it together.

As the ship approaches, you know that this adventure is just the beginning. You've discovered strengths you didn't know you had, and you're ready to take on whatever comes next.

The ship docks, and you're greeted by the relieved faces of the rescue crew. As you board the ship and sail away from the island, you can't help but look back. The island, once a place of danger and mystery, now feels almost like home.

But as the island fades into the distance, you know that you're ready to face a new day. After all, every sunrise is a new adventure."

_ðŸ¤– This conclusion provides a satisfying end to the adventure, leaving the players with a sense of accomplishment and anticipation for future adventures._

_ðŸ¤– Here's a humorous dice roll for the conclusion that could lead to a surprising twist._

ðŸ“¢ "As you board the rescue ship, you notice a crate of coconuts. Eager for a change from the island's fruits and fish, you decide to have a coconut feast to celebrate your rescue.

`Sam`, you decide to use your strength to open the coconuts. (Roll D6 + STR)

Oh no! You rolled a 1! You swing your fist with all your might, but instead of hitting the coconut, you hit the crate. The crate tips over, sending coconuts rolling all over the deck.

The coconuts roll into the ship's wheel, causing the ship to lurch to the side. Everyone on board is thrown off balance, and you all stumble towards the railing.

You teeter on the edge, trying to regain your balance. (Roll D6 for each player)

Oh no! Everyone rolled a 1! You all tumble over the railing and into the sea. The rescue crew throws lifebuoys, and you all manage to grab one. 

Laughing and spluttering, you're pulled back onto the ship. You're all soaked and a little embarrassed, but otherwise fine. 

The coconut incident will definitely be a story to remember. And as the ship sails away from the island, you can't help but laugh. Even in rescue, it seems, the island had one last surprise for you."

_ðŸ¤– This funny dice roll adds a humorous twist to the conclusion, reminding the players that even in victory, there's always room for a little chaos and fun._

_ðŸ¤– If the dice roll is successful, you can still make the situation humorous. Here's how._

ðŸ“¢ "You decide to use your strength to open the coconuts. You roll the dice... and it's a success! You swing your fist and successfully crack open the coconut. However, you didn't anticipate the force of the coconut water which sprays in all directions, soaking everyone nearby!

Everyone is surprised and then bursts into laughter, wiping coconut water from their faces. Even the rescue crew members can't help but join in the laughter.

In the midst of your coconut feast, you accidentally kick a coconut which rolls and hits the ship's bell, ringing it loudly. The crew jumps, thinking it's an emergency, only to see you all laughing and enjoying your coconut feast.

The coconut incident, as it will forever be known, adds a touch of humor to your rescue. As the ship sails away from the island, you all share a laugh, creating one final unforgettable memory of your adventure on the island."
