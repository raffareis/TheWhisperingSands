# **Chapter 1 - Survival**

## **DM Notes**

In this chapter, the immediate survival needs of the characters come to the forefront. They need to find food, water, and create some form of shelter. This is an excellent opportunity for the players to use their characters' skills and start working as a team. 

The island holds plenty of resources, but finding and making use of them might not be straightforward. There are also the strange symbols to consider. While survival is the immediate priority, the mystery of the island starts to unfold.

## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "As the initial shock wears off, you realize that you need to focus on survival. The tropical sun is hot, and you're already feeling thirsty. You also need food and a place to rest.

`Emily`, with your survival skills, you start looking for a source of fresh water and any edible plants or fruits. `Sam`, you use your strength to gather wood and other materials for a shelter. `Liz`, you're intrigued by the strange symbols and start examining them more closely.

As you work, you start to discover the island's resources. A freshwater stream, a grove of fruit trees, and even some fish in the stream. But you also find more symbols, more signs that you might not be alone.

By the time the sun begins to set, you've managed to set up a basic camp. You're tired, but you've made it through your first day. As you sit around the fire, eating the fruits and fish you've found, you can't help but wonder about the symbols and the mysteries of the island.

What do you want to do next?"


_ðŸ¤– Here's how we can connect player actions to the next chapter._

## **DM Notes**

After ensuring their immediate survival, the players' curiosity about the island and its mysteries should naturally lead them to explore. Whether they decide to investigate the symbols, look for other signs of life, or find a way to signal for help, all these actions can lead into Chapter 2.

The key is to be flexible and adapt the story to the players' actions. For example, if they decide to explore the island, you can describe them finding ancient ruins or other signs of previous inhabitants. If they decide to investigate the symbols, you can reveal more clues about the island's history and the curse. If they try to signal for help, you can introduce the curse's effects by having their attempts mysteriously fail.

ðŸ“¢ "After a restful night's sleep, you wake up feeling more determined. The island is still a mystery, and you're eager to uncover its secrets. 

Whether you decide to explore the island's interior, investigate the symbols more closely, or try to find a high point to signal for help, you're ready to take action.

As you move deeper into the island, you discover ancient ruins, more symbols, and a strange, ominous feeling. The island is not as deserted as it first appeared. The symbols, the ruins...everything points to a past that is somehow still present.

Your actions today will shape your journey. The island is full of mysteries, and it's up to you to uncover them." 

_ðŸ¤– This way, the players' actions naturally lead into the exploration and mystery-solving part of the story, setting the stage for Chapter 2._
