Sitting up, you take in your surroundings. The beach stretches out on either side, a wide expanse of golden sand meeting the clear turquoise waters. Behind you, the beach gives way to lush greenery, palm trees swaying gently in the breeze and providing a welcome shade from the sun.

You see the remnants of your boat scattered along the shoreline, a grim reminder of the storm that wrecked your journey. But beyond that, the island seems peaceful, almost idyllic.

Despite the initial shock, a sense of determination settles in. You're stranded on this island, but you're not alone. Together, you'll find a way to survive and uncover the secrets the island holds."
