_ðŸ¤– Here's a detailed description of the moment when Emily finds the talisman._

## **DM Script**

ðŸ“¢ "As you delve deeper into the cave, the air grows cooler, and the narrow passageway opens up into a large chamber. The chamber is filled with stalactites and stalagmites, and the walls glisten with moisture. But what catches your eye is a faint glow coming from the far end of the chamber.

`Emily`, you cautiously approach the source of the glow. As you draw closer, you see an object embedded in the wall. It's an ancient talisman, intricately carved and glowing with a soft, pulsating light. The talisman is made of a strange metal you can't identify, and it's covered in the same symbols you've seen scattered around the island.

As you reach out and touch the talisman, a jolt of energy courses through you. The cave trembles, and the talisman dislodges from the wall, falling into your outstretched hand. The moment you hold the talisman, you feel a strange connection to it, as if it's speaking to you, whispering ancient secrets in your mind.

The discovery of the talisman marks a turning point in your adventure. You've awakened something on the island, setting in motion events that will lead to the ultimate challenge of breaking the island's curse."
